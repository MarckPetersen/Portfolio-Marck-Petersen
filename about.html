    <h2>Meet Marck Petersen</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Marck Petersen, a seasoned Quality Assurance wizard who has transitioned to developing innovative solutions using tools like ChatGPT, Gherkin syntax, and GitHub to design and describe software without writing traditional code. Think of me as the Sherlock Holmes of QA—but instead of solving crimes, I solve bugs and inefficiencies. With over 30 years of experience in Quality Assurance and Test Management, I've danced my way through waterfall and agile projects, ensuring software perfection across platforms and industries.</p>

    <h3>Professional Life</h3>
    <p>I've led QA efforts for top companies, from Saxo Bank to Pensiondanmark, and now I'm embracing a new chapter—developing software through modern tools that let me focus on design and functionality without manual coding. Need a test plan? Done. Need an exploratory testing guru? I'm your guy. Need someone who can make risk-based testing sound like an adventure? Look no further. My superpower? Turning chaos into order while making sure no bug gets past my watchful eyes.</p>

    <h3>Private Life</h3>
    <p>When I'm not battling software gremlins, you'll find me soaking up life with my Brazilian wife and our 12-year-old daughter. Whether it's relaxing at our summer house on Orø or basking in the sun on Ilha de Itamaracá, I bring the same energy to family time as I do to work. And yes, I speak Portuguese—so I can assure you that bugs sound just as bad in another language!</p>

    <h3>A Bit More About Me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fitness Buff:</strong> Staying active keeps me sharp and ready to tackle any challenge.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Solver:</strong> Dyslexia hasn't stopped me; it's made me think outside the box and find creative solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Team Player:</strong> Collaboration and communication are my bread and butter.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, whether you're here to explore my projects, seek inspiration, or simply learn more about me, welcome to the Marck Petersen experience—where passion meets precision, and software gets the TLC it deserves!</p>
